# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks and Word Embeddings

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using the famous Sentiment140 dataset. The analysis is carried out using neural networks and word embeddings to classify the sentiment of tweets into positive or negative categories.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of tweets using machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on:
- **Neural Networks**: Using deep learning models to capture the complex patterns in tweet data.
- **Word Embeddings**: Representing words as dense vectors, which help capture the semantic meaning of words and their relationships.

## Methodology

- **Dataset**: The Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million labeled tweets, is used for training and testing the model. The tweets are labeled with sentiment labels (positive or negative).
- **Neural Networks**: A deep learning model is built to classify the sentiment of tweets based on their text content.
- **Word Embeddings**: Pretrained word embeddings are used to transform the words in the tweets into numerical representations that the neural network can process. These embeddings help improve the model's ability to understand word relationships and context.
- **Model Training**: The neural network model is trained on the dataset, adjusting parameters to optimize accuracy and performance.

## Key Findings

- The use of **word embeddings** significantly improved the modelâ€™s ability to understand the context of words and their sentiment.
- Neural networks provided an effective way to capture complex patterns in the textual data, outperforming simpler models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of neural networks and word embeddings to sentiment analysis, specifically for classifying the sentiment of tweets. The results showcase how advanced machine learning techniques can be used to process and understand text data in a more nuanced way.
